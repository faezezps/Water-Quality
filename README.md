# Water-Quality

## Introduction

Based on the standards for water usage, water quality describes its chemical, physical, and biological characteristics. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality) There are various features such as temperature, acidity (pH), dissolved solids (specific conductance), particulate matter (turbidity), dissolved oxygen, hardness, and suspended sediment to ascertain the quality of water. [2](https://www.michiganseagrant.org/lessons/lessons/by-broad-concept/earth-science/water-quality/)	In this project, considering the available datasets, we take three properties into account. These three properties are: **Temperature**, **Acidity â€“ pH**, and **Turbidity** ( that "is the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid caused by large numbers of individual particles that are generally invisible to the naked eye, similar to smoke in the air. The measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality." [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbidity). ) 

We visualized values of all of these parameters and calculated the correlation between each of them. Then, we designed regression models to predict the value of each of these parameters. Furthermore, we implemented deep LSTM model to forecast all three parameters at once considering their changes in the past.
